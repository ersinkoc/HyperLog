# Contributing to HyperLog

We love your input! We want to make contributing to HyperLog as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes with 90%+ coverage
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Run `npm run lint` to check your code
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- Run `npm test` to run the test suite
- Run `npm run bench` to check performance
